/**
 * EventList is a supporting class for the logging system and allows subset of messages
 * emitted by the SDK to be collected and inspected by the SDK users. The events are stored
 * in an ordered list, each element being a dictionary of string keys and string values.
 *
 * Upon completion of the API call, the recorded events can be inspected by the host application
 * to determine what step to take to address the issue. To simply list all events and their elements,
 * a simple for-each like this will work:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *         corpus.getCtx().getEvents().forEach(logEntry -> {
 *             logEntry.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println(key + "=" + value));
 *          });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Note: this class is NOT a replacement for standard logging mechanism employed by the SDK. It serves
 * specifically to offer immediate post-call context specific diagnostic information for the application
 * to automate handling of certain common problems, such as invalid file name being supplied, file already
 * being present on the file-system, etc.
