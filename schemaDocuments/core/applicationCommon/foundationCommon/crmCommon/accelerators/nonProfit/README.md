A credit plan could "counted" for membership or other benefit prior to a payment actually being cleared. A Credit Plan shows up as a A line item attached to a Pledge, Payment Schedule, or Account .  The goal of a credit plan is to avoid the double counting of hard, soft and split crediting.  The most elegant way to manage Credit Plan is by ensuring there are business rules in place like an "auto" soft credit rule attached to Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities or Donor Commitments depending on the conditions met.  Credit Plans can be countable toward fulfilling a benefit even if they are never fully realized as a hard or soft credit.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_CreditPlan)|

And still more orgs hard credit Benevity some or all of the $100 donation.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_CreditRecipient)|

|[**DesignationPlan**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/DesignationPlan.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|A line item attached to a Pledge, Payment Schedule, or Campaign indicating how associated payments should be designated.  Sometimes, 100% of a donation is designated to a single fund (ideally, to an unrestricted fund that the nonprofit can use any way they wish).  Other times, a donor has specified a desire that the donation be "split designated" among two or more funds.  For example, a donor giving $5,000 might specify that $1000 goes to the unrestricted fund $1000 to the new building fund and $3000 to building water wells Sub-saharan Africa.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_DesignationPlan)|

|[**Education**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/Education.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|Biographical information about the education institutions a contact attended or is attending, the areas of study (major/minor) concentrated on, activities and roles served, preferences (football booster, patron of the on-campus art museum, etc.), and the start and end dates associated with this information.  It's particularly important for mid-level and major gift fundraisers based in the United States to understand someone's university/college alumni/alumnae network and peers in order to build a bigger qualified prospect pipeline.  University/college association is not as relevant or important in the UK, for example, compared to the US.  Nonprofit organizations with a bigger focus on major gifts care more about tracking educational information at a deeper level.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_Education)|
|[**EmploymentHistory**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/EmploymentHistory.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|Historical and/or current information about where a contact works, volunteers or serves in some capacity at an organization.  For nonprofits, tracking employer information is critical for a few reasons: it is important to understand if the employee is part of a eligible matching gift program, to have visibility into an employee's "network" and to visualize the degrees of separation between an employee and other prospective donors that the organization wants to solicit, and more.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_EmploymentHistory)|
|[**Indicator**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/Indicator.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|An Indicator describes what will be measured to track evidence of a Result.

|[**Objective**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/Objective.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|Used for the purpose of reporting on goals or strategies outside of program boundaries.  For example, "Advocacy" may be an objective of both "Health Care" and "Education". An objective is often a step above program in terms of hierarchy.  So, a Foundation may have 5 key objectives to fund for a particular fiscal year.  Related and underneath objectives like Advocacy, Job Training, and Literarcy might be any number of additional, related programs, all of which are seeking to award grants to qualified grant seekers.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_Objective)|
|[**OfacMatch**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/OfacMatch.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|Prospective, pending and closed "deals" or gifts.  This entity allows nonprofit organizations to track their efforts to build relationships with prospective donors.   The following information is commonly tracked on opportunities:  assigned fundraiser(s), ask amounts, campaigns designated funds given to, etc.   Opportunity pipeline management allows development and gift officers to forecast likely gifts by when they are going to close, very similar to the way a salesperson tracks and manages sales opportunities.  It must be possible in a CRM or application to associate an opportunity to a campaign to measure the ROI of specific marketing programs.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_OfacMatch)|

In addition, it can be a pledge (ie, promise) of a future payment or a current/received payment.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_PaymentSchedule)|
|[**PlannedGiving**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/PlannedGiving.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|A planned gift is a major gift made during a donor's lifetime or at the time of their death that involves their estate and tax planning.  There are many forms of planned giving, but the three most common vehicles are CRTs (Charitable Remainder Trusts), Bequests and Annuities, which all have different tax benefits and financial reconciliation guidelines for the nonprofit organization. Planned gifts are in contrast to annual gifts, which are made through a donor's discretionary income and not tied to an estate.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_PlannedGiving)|
|[**Preference**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/Preference.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|Typically tracks an abundance of constituent or organization information that doesn't live cleanly on an account or contact record, or that can be associated with both an Account and a Contact.  Examples:  personal interests, additional communication preferences like desire to receive a newsletter, specific outreach the constituent wants, and additional affiliation information like Constituent Type associations and ratings. Preferences also typically store demographic information in a series of dependent picklists: Category, Subcategory, Type, Subtype. Most commonly, only two or three of the fields in this dependent hierarchy will be used.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_Preference)|

|[**Request**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/Request.cdm.json)|[nonProfit/](https://github.com/Microsoft/CDM/blob/master/schemaDocuments/core/applicationCommon/foundationCommon/crmCommon/accelerators/nonProfit/)|Represents a request from an individual or institution for funding or support. A request is more formal than an inquiry (LOI) and typically happens after an inquiry has already occurred.|[Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/msnfp_request)|
